# English-Learning-Dice-Game
### Overview
This project involves creating an application that helps users learn English vocabulary through a dice game. The game is designed as a variant of the traditional board game "The Game of the Goose." Originally played with two dice on a board with 63 spaces arranged in a spiral, our version of the game features a board with 100 numbered spaces arranged in a spiral.

### Key Features:
